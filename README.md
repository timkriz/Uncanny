# Uncanny

https://projekt-uncanny.glitch.me/

Uncanny is a student seminar created as part of the course "Interaction and information design". It is an experimental publicly available experience, which explores the fields of creative coding and new age HCI (Human Computer Interactions). The inspiration for this work is a phenomenon called "Uncanny valley" - a characteristic dip in emotional response that happens when we encounter an entity that is almost, but not quite, human. It was first hypothesised in 1970 by the japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori, who identified that as robots became more human-like, people would find them to be more acceptable and appealing than their mechanical counterparts. But this only held true to up a point. When they were close to, but not quite, human, people developed a sense of unease and discomfort.
Anything with a highly human-like appearance can be subject to the Uncanny valley effect, but the most common examples are androids, computer game characters and life-like dolls.
